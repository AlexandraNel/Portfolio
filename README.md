# Portfolio Alexandra Nel

This is a portfolio website to showcase the work of Alexandra Nel

## Description

This website showcases several portfolio pieces for prospective employers and the public that are interested in my work (the work of Alexandra Nel). These are concerned with Web Dev, Animations, and Illustration projects.

It is important to have a digital presence in order to showcase professional capabilities and this portfolio piece, built personally and for purpose, will house future and current work, as well as grow, as my skills improve.

I now have a proof of concept for future work that can be shared with prospective employers and clients.

### Technologies:

- Git Bash
- Github
- Figma
- HTML
- CSS

This application gave me time to explore, indepth, many capabilities of HTML and CSS specifically. It also gave me an introduction into the importance of wireframes and provided a crash course in figma for their construction. Although my wireframe was very useful, I found the design developed as my knowledge of CSS and HTML expanded.

## Roadmap
I believe the interactivity, animation, content and design of this application will develop as my knowledge expands and its capability is required. Some of the following are things that I would like to implement

- expand on the interaction of the portfolio pieces, introducing labels
- improving the layout of the design on larger screens
- adding illustrations and animation pieces that interact and display on interaction
- adjusting the fluid movement of the site
- adding fun features like custom mouse icons
- improving the portfolio pieces and links
- adding a blog page
- expanding on social media references
- adding a contact form
